# 3D-quadrotor-control

In this assignment, I will extend the controller I developed earlier for a full 3D quadrotor. In addition, I will write a trajectory generator which outputs time parameterized trajectories which allow a quadrotor to fly through a given set of waypoints.

I will be testing your controller with two  trajectories, the first one is a  line trajectory and the  second one is a helical trajectory. The aim is to  get my controller to follow each trajectory such that the error  between the desired position from the trajectory and the actual position  of the robot is small.
 The evaluation of this part is by using your trajectory generator with your controller to fly a quadrotor through a given set of waypoints.
